# CSharpEssentials.LoggerHelper.Dashboard

The **LoggerHelper Dashboard** provides a lightweight UI to visualize logs, traces, metrics, and sink errors in real time.  
It is designed to work seamlessly with the `CSharpEssentials.LoggerHelper.Sink.Telemetry` package, offering:

- **Traces view** â€“ inspect distributed traces with correlation via `trace_id`.  
- **Metrics view** â€“ monitor key performance and application metrics.  
- **Errors view** â€“ quickly detect sink initialization issues or logging misconfigurations.  

The dashboard is intended as a companion to the core logging library.
