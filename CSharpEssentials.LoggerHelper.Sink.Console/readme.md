## Introduction

The **Console Sink** for **CSharpEssentials.LoggerHelper** lets you output structured Serilog events directly to the console (standard output), with support for colored output and JSON/text formatting.  
It plugs into the LoggerHelper **HUB** core via the `ISinkPlugin` mechanism, so you can route console-based logging based on your HUB configuration (e.g. per-level routing).

### 🚀 Version 4.0.12 — Custom Console Sink and Dashboard Sync

This release updates the package version to **4.0.12* and introduces the new **`CustomConsoleSink`** class. Implementing the Serilog `ILogEventSink` interface, `CustomConsoleSink` manages the formatting and writing of log messages to the console. It features **log level-based coloring** for each message, which significantly enhances log visibility and debugging efficiency.

The integration enhancements from previous versions are maintained: the **Console Sink** continues to **forward console messages directly to the LoggerHelper Dashboard** for real-time visualization, even at application startup. This can be further **extended and customized** using the `TraceDashBoardSync` and `TraceDashBoardAsync` methods.

> 🧠 In short: version 4.0.12 boosts console logging with the customizable `CustomConsoleSink` for improved visibility and maintains Dashboard synchronization.


### ⚡ Version 4.0.11 — Extended Console Integration

Starting from **version 4.0.10**, the **Console Sink** can now **forward console messages directly to the LoggerHelper Dashboard**.  
This enhancement allows developers to **visualize all console output inside the web dashboard** right at application startup — perfect for monitoring initialization steps and early configuration logs.

Additionally, this integration can be **extended and customized** within your own projects by leveraging the `TraceDashBoardSync` and `TraceDashBoardAsync` methods, giving you full control over how console logs are collected and displayed.

> 🧠 In short: version 4.0.10 connects the Console Sink to the Dashboard for real-time visibility at startup — and lets you extend it for your own logging scenarios.
