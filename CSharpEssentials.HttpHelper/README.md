## üì¶ Package

### üõ†Ô∏è Change Log [Version 4.0.5] 

#### **1. Feature: Custom HttpClient Handler Support**

A significant improvement has been introduced to allow users to inject a custom `SocketsHttpHandler` when configuring a named `HttpClient`. This enhancement provides granular control over network behavior, such as connection settings, proxy configuration, and automatic HTTP compression.

**Example: Enabling Automatic HTTP Compression**

You can now configure automatic HTTP decompression for your named client:

```csharp
var handler = new SocketsHttpHandler 
{
    // Enable automatic decompression for GZip and Deflate
    AutomaticDecompression = System.Net.DecompressionMethods.GZip | System.Net.DecompressionMethods.Deflate,
};

builder.Services.AddHttpClients(builder.Configuration, handler);
```

`CSharpEssentials.HttpHelper` is a lightweight helper to simplify the usage of `HttpClient` in .NET with a fluent, configurable API.  
It provides convenient methods for request customization, retries, timeouts, authentication headers, and more.
